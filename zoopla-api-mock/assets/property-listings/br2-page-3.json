So call to register your interest now!General information:Bromley is a large suburban district of south east London, [1] England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley. It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",

      "description": "Spacious two double bedroom, two bathroom apartment to rent within half A mile of bromley south...Within a five minute approx. Walk to Bromley South mainline station, offering excellent commuter trains is this sumptuous two double bedroom London style apartment. In one of Bromley’s most exclusive blocks, with an allocated parking space this second floor flat is serviced by an upscale lift. The welcoming hallway sets off the tone of the flat with magnificent wooden floors and classic cream walls. Natural light floods into the dual aspect l-shape lounge through two large Juliette balconies. The divine lounge encompasses enough space to create the illusion of two separate living spaces, one to house a dining table and chairs for entertaining, and the other a seating area. The Juliette balconies offer views over Bromley turning this living room into a vibrantly engaging space. The stylish kitchen is fitted with sleek modern appliances and is entered via an archway from the lounge. A perfect contemporary cooking space filled with warm natural sunlight from the Juliette balconies adjacent. The property has two substantial double bedrooms both with fitted mirror door wardrobes. The master bedroom has attached a fresh en-suite shower room, with fittings in shiny chrome adding a contemporary touch. A pristine pure white tiled second bathroom offers a bath tub with shower over bath and cleverly incorporates a heated towel rail. Available end of March. View now!General information:Bromley is a large suburban district of south east London, [1] England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley. It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",

The property features a large open plan kitchen / reception room with tiled flooring, two good sized double bedrooms, modern tiled family bathroom and a private patio area. Offered part furnished and including beds, sofa, coffee table, dining table and wardrobes. Available March. View now!General Information:Bromley is a large suburban district of south east London, [1] England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley. It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",

View now!General information:Bromley is a large suburban district of south east London, [1] England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley. It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",

It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",

Register your interest now!General Information:Bromley is a large suburban district of south east London, [1] England, and the administrative headquarters of the London Borough of Bromley. It was historically a market town, and prior to 1965 was in the county of Kent and formed the administrative centre of the Municipal Borough of Bromley. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commercial and retail hub. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London.[2] It is located 9.3 miles (15 km) south east of Charing Cross and is one of the major metropolitan centres identified in the London Plan.",
