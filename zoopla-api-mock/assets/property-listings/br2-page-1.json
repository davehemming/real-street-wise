      "description": "The largest penthouse apartment extending to over 2700 sq ft. With superb views over beautifully tended gardens including a magnificent natural lake, located within the unique Keston Waterside gated development is one of eight individually designed properties. Less than 15 miles from central London, all accommodation has been sympathetically crafted from a Victorian red brick villa. This penthouse apartment has well-proportioned interiors finished to a superior design specification, and includes three good size bedrooms, all with en suites. Double doors lead to two west facing balconies - which are accessed from the lounge and kitchen to provide a great space in which to relax and also entertain. In addition, the roof terrace offers private space to enjoy the good weather. With Orpington train station 1.8 miles from the property, offering fast services into London and Locksbottom Village under half a mile, this apartment must be viewed to be truly appreciated",

      "description": "There are some homes, that from the moment you step inside, you feel that you are about to see something special. This 6 bedroom early Victorian home is one such home.There is character and charm from the moment you approach the home and admire the stained glass entrance door. The current owners have transformed this home into the wonderful home it is today. To blend modern contemporary features and decor whilst still retaining character and charm in an older house is an art to do well but as you continue to look around you cannot help being impressed with what has been achieved here.The home not only has its beauty but is functional too. As a family home you could not wish for more with so many reception rooms to utilise and such great sized bedrooms.Downstairs you have a choice of 4 reception rooms. There is a large Dining Room that feels bigger due to the high ceilings and arch bay window to the front. It is conveniently positioned off of the beautifully appointed Kitchen. The white units and black galaxy marble work tops add that touch of modern that all will love. If you have older children then they will probably want to adopt the Sitting Room as their own for when friends visit or would be great as a large Family Room. The larger rear Lounge is probably where the whole family can congregate of an evening to relax in front of the T.V or catch up on the day's events. Having bi-fold doors that open the Lounge into the Conservatory and then out into the garden makes this an ideal layout for entertaining a large group of friends and family. The number and size of the rooms downstairs will certainly impress you and everyone will have their own ideas on how to utilise them. The final part of the downstairs is a separate Utility Room and W.C, important for any busy family home.Upstairs is as equally impressive. There should not be any problems on room allocations here as there are 5 excellent sized double bedrooms and a reasonable sized single that could always be a study if you wished. The Master Bedroom has its own En-suite that is big enough to hold its own bath as well as shower cubicle. The other 3 bedrooms on this level then have use of the family bathroom whilst the 2 bedrooms on the upper floor have use of their own Shower Room.Outside are gardens for the whole family to enjoy. There is a patio area to enjoy al-fresco dining or just to relax on. The garden is virtually maintenance free having a synthetic lawn. No need for cutting and ideal for the children to use all year round. If you work from home, want space to pursue a hobby or just want somewhere sheltered to relax in then the Log Cabin has a multitude of uses.The location is the last benefit that will make this home so popular. For commuting you will enjoy the convenience of having Bromley South less than a mile away which has a journey time of 15 minutes into Victoria. The renowned Raglands primary School is less than a quarter mile away making the school run a 5 minute walk even for little legs. For walking the dog or going for a run you have the choice of Bromley Common or Norman Park Recreation Ground, both of which are again a walk away.Entrance HallwaySitting Room15'5\" (4.70m) into bay x 12'5\" (3.78m)Dining Room15'9\" (4.80m) x 12'4\" (3.76m)Lounge24'11\" (7.59m) x 12'5\" (3.78m)Conservatory11'6\" (3.51m) x 9'8\" (2.95m)Kitchen12'6\" (3.81m) x 12'3\" (3.73m) with further recess of 5'5\" (1.65m)Utility Room7'10\" (2.39m) x 5'3\" (1.60m)CloakroomFirst FloorMaster Bedroom15'11\" (4.85m) x 12'2\" (3.71m)En-Suite for Master bedroomBedroom 215'11\" (4.85m) x 12'2\" (3.71m)Bedroom 313'1\" (3.99m) x 9'11\" (3.02m)Bedroom 412'3\" (3.73m) x 6'6\" (1.98m)Family Bathroom8'1\" (2.46m) x 5'4\" (1.63m)Second FloorBedroom 516'6\" (5.03m) x 10'4\" (3.15m)Bedroom 616'9\" (5.11m) x 8'4\" (2.54m)Shower RoomOutsideDriveway to front for 2-3 cars.Rear garden with patio and synthetic grass leading to:Log Cabin with Attached Shed19'8\" (5.99m) x 10'9\" (3.28m)",

      "description": "A delightful and superbly presented, 1930s built, 3 Bedroomed, Semi Detached, ‘ Art Deco ‘ style family home located just minutes from Ravensbourne railway station and backing onto Warren Avenue playing fields.Ideally located for the commuter, Ravensbourne offers regular services into The City via London Blackfriars. The property is approximately 15 minutes walk to Shortlands railway station offering further services into the West End via London Victoria.The property is also located just yards from the 354 bus route, serving Central Bromley and Beckenham Town Centre. Bromley town centre is just a short drive away with well over 400 retail units to choose from, Bromley is one of the most extensive shopping centres in the region. The intu Shopping Centre boasts over 130 stores alone and Shortlands golf club is also within easy reach.In our opinion this property is the perfect purchase for those with a young family or those looking to start a family in an established residential area and highly sought after location. The property is also ideal for those who may work from home or for those who may care for elderly relatives, such is the volume of living space on offer.The accommodation has been lovingly enhanced and modernised to a high standard by the current owners and is offered to the market in very good condition, whilst retaining much of the charm and character associated with properties of this era, including original oak flooring and internal doors and has been skilfully blended with an array of contemporary themes. Externally, the property features a shared shingle driveway with off street parking for 3 vehicles leading to the garage.The rear garden features a wide variety of shrubs set within shaped borders and lawn, a rockery, timber decked patio and childrens play area which needs to be viewed to be fully appreciated and to absorb the time and effort the current owners have invested in the outside space.With side access leading to the Entrance Hall with oak wood flooring and cloak cupboard the property flows beautifully throughout. With a larger than average Living room and Dining Room overlooking the rear garden, the ground floor is further complemented with a fully equipped Kitchen.The first floor features 3 exceptionally well proportioned bedrooms together with a contemporary bathroom suite.
